        <h3> तुम्हारे बिना कुछ भी पहले जैसा नहीं रहेगा, लेकिन चिंता मत करो - मेरे दिल में हमेशा तुम्हारे लिए जगह रहेगी। मेरे सबसे अच्छे दोस्त, मैं तुम्हें शुभकामनाएं देता हूं क्योंकि तुम इससे कम के हकदार नहीं हो। हर विदाई एक सूर्यास्त है जो हमेशा सूर्योदय का इंतजार करता है।</h3>
       
<h2 style="color: cyan;">In halls of chalk and humming light,
We chase the day, we chase the night.
Books our burden, dreams our guide,
With restless hope we walk with pride.

The bell may ring, the clock may chime,
But thoughts still race beyond the time.
From lecture halls to late-night tea,
We build the selves we're yet to be.

With pages worn and minds half-clear,
We face each test with doubt and cheer.
Friendships bloom in sleepless hours,
In quiet rooms, we find our powers.

Mistakes are made, and lessons stay,
As wisdom carves its silent way.
For every grade, a story told—
Of courage young and questions bold.

So raise your pens, your hearts, your eyes—
Beyond the walls, the future lies.
Though student days may one day end,
Their echoes in our souls extend.</h2>
<h3>"Success doesn't come from what you do occasionally, it comes from what you do consistently."

"Don’t watch the clock; do what it does—keep going."

"Your future is created by what you do today, not tomorrow."

"The expert in anything was once a beginner."

"Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you."

"Great things never come from comfort zones."

"Failure is not the opposite of success, it's part of success."

"You don’t have to be perfect, you just have to be persistent."

"Discipline is doing what needs to be done, even when you don’t feel like doing it."

"Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you greater than any obstacle."
